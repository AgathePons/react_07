# Github API

Small app to put into practice all the notions I have learnd on the past few days.

For more infos on the React notions : **[See the React blog repo](https://github.com/AgathePons/react_06_hooks_router_API_blog)**

## React

The app is developed with the **[React library](https://en.reactjs.org/)**.

## Hooks

Some hooks from React or from React Router are used

## Controlled component

The input field is plugged to the state using `onChange()`

## React Router

To handle fake routes and url navigation, I used **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)**.

## Axios

To handle the fetch API, I used **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)**.

## Semantic UI React

To handle some already styled components, I used **[Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)**.
